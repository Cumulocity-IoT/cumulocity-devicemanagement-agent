# Cumulocity IoT Device Management Reference Agent
Cumulocity Device Management (DM) Reference Agent written in Python3 to demonstrate most of the [Device Management Capabilities](https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/device-management/) of [Cumulocity IoT](https://www.softwareag.cloud/site/product/cumulocity-iot.html)

# Quick Start

To quickly run the agent just make sure that Docker is installed on your computer an run

    ./start.sh

in a console of your choice. The script will build a docker image and starting one instance afterwards.
When bootstrapping is used the docker container Id is the device Id which should be entered when registering a device in cumulocity.

If you don't want to run within docker follow the steps below.

# Configuration

The agent can be configured via the agent.ini which must be placed in 

    {userFolder}/.cumulocity

When running in docker container the agent.ini can be mounted to the /root/.cumulocity/agent.ini

Below a reference agent.ini is proviced:

```console
[mqtt]
url = mqtt.eu-latest.cumulocity.com
port = 8883
tls = true
cert_auth = false
client_cert = s7y_pi.crt
client_key = s7y_pi.key
cacert = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
ping.interval.seconds = 60

[agent]
name = dm-example-device
type = c8y_dm_example_device
main.loop.interval.seconds = 10
requiredinterval = 10
loglevel = INFO
```
| Category | Property   | Description
| ---------|:----------:|:-----------
| mqtt     | url        | The URL of the Cumulocity MQTT endpoint
| mqtt     | port       | The Port of the Cumulocity MQTT endpoint
| mqtt     | tls        | True when using port 8883, false when using port 1883 
| mqtt     | cert_auth  | true when you want use Device Certificates for Device Authentication

| mqtt     | client_key  | Path to your private key for Authentication
| mqtt     | ping.interval.seconds | Interval in seconds for the mqtt client to send pings to MQTT Broker to keep the connection alive.
| agent    | name       | The prefix name of the Device in Cumulocity. The serial will be attached with a "-" e.g. dm-example-device-1234567.
| agent    | type       | The Device Type in Cumulocity
| agent    | main.loop.interval.seconds | The interval in seconds sensor data will be forwarded to Cumulocity
| agent    | requiredinterval | The interval in minutes for Cumulocity to detect that the device is online/offline.
| agent    | loglevel   | The log level to write and print to file/console. 
# Build

The agent can be build in multiple ways.
## Building via pip

To build the agent via pip just run

    pip install -r requirements.txt

 to install dependencies and afterwards

    pip install .

to build the agent itself.
Please note that in debian/ubuntu you need additionally install

    apt install python-apt

via apt.
## Building debian package

In order to build the .deb yourself first install python-stdeb via apt.

    apt install python-stdeb

 Afterwards run

    python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb

on the level of the setup.py.

In oder to install the debian package locally run

    apt install ./deb_dist/python-c8ydm_0.1-1_all.deb 

## Building docker image

To build a docker image you can make use of the provided [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile).

Example:
```console
docker build -t dm-image -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

# Run

## Python

Before running the agent some manual steps need to be taken

1. Manually put the [config file](./config/agent.ini) into /root/.cumulocity

You can run the agent by executing

```console
sudo c8ydm.start
```
in your console when you used [Building via pip](#building-via-pip) to build and install the agent.

## apt / Debian package

Before running the agent some manual steps need to be taken

1. Manually put the [config file](./config/agent.ini) into /root/.cumulocity

You can run the agent by executing

```console
sudo c8ydm.start
```
in your console when you used [Building via deb](#building-debian-package) to build and install the agent.

## Docker

You can run the agent by executing

```console
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dm-image
```
in your console when you used [Building Docker Image](#building-docker-image) to build and install the agent.

The config can be mounted the container. Otherwise the default config will be used.

# Develop

## Dev Container
The project comes with VS Code devcontainer support. Make sure you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in combination with docker. Just open the project in VS Code and click on "Reopen in Dev Container".

In the background the Agent will be build and started. Also a debug/run configuration is provided so you can easilly start/debug the agent within VS Code. 

### Using certificate authentication

The container is built along with certificates, which are placed at `/root/.cumulocity/certs`. 
You can add the generated root certificate to your tenant's trusted certificate list by executing the script like below:

```
./scripts/upload_cert.sh \
--tenant-domain <tenant domain> \
--tenant-id <tenant ID> \
--username <username for the tenant> \
--password <password for the tenant> \
--cert-path /root/.cumulocity/certs/iot-ca.pem \
--cert-name <(arbitrary) displayed name of the root certificate>
```

After this, you can connect the agent to your tenant using cert authentication (with the serial `pyagent0001`).

## Extending the agent

The agent knows three types of classes that it will automatically load and include from the "agentmodules" directory.

1. Sensors

        class Sensor:
          __metaclass__ = ABCMeta

          def __init__(self, serial):
            self.serial = serial

          '''
          Returns a list of SmartREST messages. Will be called every iteration of the main loop.
          '''
          @abstractmethod
          def getSensorMessages(self): pass

   Sensors are periodically polled by the main loop and published.

2. Listeners

        class Listener:
          __metaclass__ = ABCMeta

          def __init__(self, serial, agent):
            self.serial = serial
            self.agent = agent

          '''
          Callback that is executed for any operation received
          '''
          @abstractmethod
          def handleOperation(self, message): pass

          '''
          Returns a list of supported operations
          '''
          @abstractmethod
          def getSupportedOperations(self): pass

          '''
          Returns a list of supported SmartREST templates (X-Ids)
          '''
          @abstractmethod
          def getSupportedTemplates(self): pass

   Listeners are called whenever there is a message received on a subscribed topic.

3. Initializers

        class Initializer:
          __metaclass__ = ABCMeta

          def __init__(self, serial):
            self.serial = serial

          '''
          Returns a list of SmartREST messages. Will be called at the start of the agent
          '''
          @abstractmethod
          def getMessages(self): pass

   Initializers are only called once at the start of the agent.

You can take a look at the two example modules for how it can be used.

# Log & Configuration
The logfile and configuration can be found in the following directory.

    /root/.cumulocity
